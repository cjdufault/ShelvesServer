# ShelvesServer

## A client/server project management system for small, loosely-organized projects

Created by Connor Dufault in 2020

This is the server component of the Shelves project. It runs an HTTP server that accepts requests from the [client application](https://github.com/cjdufault/ShelvesClient) and manages the database.
